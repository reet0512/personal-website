## I created a website from scratch with React to act as a portfolio for my technical and personal experiences. The experiences are interactable Modals that display my roles in-depth while the projects are buttons that link to my deliverable project which has more information on the project.

## Premise
This website has a brief summary of my personal and professional experiences, with a section dedicated to the top articles in tech (to showcase the data access portion of the DALI challenge). The website is built primarily using React. The experiences are interactable Modals that display my roles in-depth while the projects are buttons that link to my the place where these projects are hosted.
